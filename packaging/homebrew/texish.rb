# Homebrew formula for the texish command-line tool.
#
# This is a template: the four SHA256 fields are filled in per release from the assets the
# "Release binaries" workflow attaches. See README.md in this directory for how, and for how to
# publish the result to the edadma/homebrew-texish tap.
#
# The formula installs a prebuilt binary rather than building from source, because building means
# a JDK, sbt, Scala Native's LLVM toolchain and a full compile — a lot to ask of a package that
# ships as one static-ish executable. Cairo, FreeType and libjpeg-turbo remain runtime dependencies
# because the binary links against them.
